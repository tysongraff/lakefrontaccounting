      <p>
        Lakefront Accounting is a CPA firm focused on providing thoughtful,
        relationship-driven accounting and tax services to individuals,
        small businesses, and real estate investors.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe accounting should go beyond compliance. Our goal is to help
        clients understand their numbers, plan proactively, and make confident
        financial decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Background</h2>

      <p>
        Our firm is led by CPAs with deep experience in the real estate industry
        and small business advisory. We regularly work with:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Real estate investors and rental property owners</li>
        <li>Entrepreneurs and closely held businesses</li>
        <li>S-Corporations and pass-through entities</li>
        <li>Individuals with complex tax situations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Work</h2>

      <p>
        We take a proactive, collaborative approach with every client. That
        means clear communication, timely advice, and strategies tailored to
        your specific situation — not one-size-fits-all solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you’re growing a business, building a real estate portfolio, or
        simply looking for a CPA you can trust, we’re here to help.
      </p>
