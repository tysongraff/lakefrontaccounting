    <p>
      Lakefront Accounting was founded to provide individuals and small business
      owners with reliable, thoughtful accounting and tax support. We believe
      clients benefit most when their CPA understands not just the numbers, but
      the decisions behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our firm works closely with clients throughout the year — not just during
      tax season — to help them stay compliant, plan ahead, and feel confident
      in their financial decisions.
